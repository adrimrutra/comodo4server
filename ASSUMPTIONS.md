### Technology:
###### The applicatin is created with `Asp.Net Core Web Api`, language `C#`.
###### Data base - `MongoDb`.
###### Connectin to Data base - `C# mongo driver`.
###### Api documentation - `Swagger`.
###### For logger - `nLog` library.


##### I used `Asp.Net Core Web Api` technology:
###### 1. Because .Net Core it is the last technology.
###### 2. It can be used in different platforms.
###### 3. It will be used in the future.

##### Through development process I enjoyed very much the technology, how the files structure are organised, 
##### there is no unnecessary files and the structure is clear for understanding.


### Patterns:
###### Repository pattern - adds an abstraction layer over the top of data access.
###### Dependency Injection (natively integrated in .Net core, controller injection)
